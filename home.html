    <h1>ELLA MAI</h1>

    <p>Ella Mai is a British singer and songwriter who is best known for her single ‘Boo’d Up’ from her EP ‘Ready.’ Born and raised in London, she moved with her family to New York when she was 12 years old. In 2014, she appeared on the music reality show ‘The X Factor’ but could not go beyond the initial stages. She then took to social media to publish her music. She used ‘SoundCloud’ to put her music online and released small video clips on ‘Instagram.’ Slowly, the trick worked and she was noticed by DJ Mustard, who then offered her a contract with ‘10 Summers Records.’ In early 2016, she released her debut EP, ‘Time,’ with the label. She then released the EPs ‘Change’ and ‘Ready.’ ‘Boo’d Up,’ a single from the third EP, became a major hit and peaked at the fifth spot on the ‘Billboard Hot 100’ chart. In 2018, she was even nominated for an ‘MTV Video Music Award.’ This helped her boost her career in the music industry. In 2018, Ella announced that she was working on her debut album and it could be released in October 2018.</p>
